Possible Errors:

	API refresh rate
		- Free API has call limit
		- Extensive calls produce error
	

Next Steps:

	Be able to refresh pages in current window instead of creating new 	windows
		- Make container a global var, and initialize page everytime it 		is called, and add to container
		
	Create a more detailed homepage with better GUI management
		- Use .grid() instead of .pack() for better placement
